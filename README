Imlementations specific are stored in fr.xebia.usi.quizz.web
You'll find in each subpackage a Main class able to run the implementation.

Once started the test can be run using ab in command line :
ab -p ./src/main/resources/user.json -c 50 -n100000 -r http://localhost:8080/api/user


All Impl use the UserManagerMemoryImpl which is Hashmap backed,
but if you've got a running mongodb instance you switch to the UserManagerMongoImpl.

To run the JEE poc you should use maven like that:
mvn package t7:run

You can switch between tomcat NIO and BIO connector by modifying main/tomcat/conf/server.xml

Also please install in your local maven repository the libs inside lib directory using
command line described in pom.xml
